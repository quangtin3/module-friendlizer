Module Friendlizer:

Design - User guide - And license (sort of)

NetBeans Platform, to help overall sytem stability, introduces "Implement Dependency": http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqImplementationDependency

This small tools can help people install Private/Customized/Enterprise Internal Use Plugins on the range of compatible-and-selftested NetBeans version without have to make each version for every NetBeans. Usually, each versions only different in dependence declaration.

The best option is asking NetBeans Developers to make your module in their moduleâ€™s friend-list. But this option is not alway available.

* How "Module Friendlizer" works?
It depends on a list of module that your module dependent on, for example:

	private static String[] modules = new String[]{
	        "ide/modules/org-netbeans-modules-html-editor-lib.jar",
	        "java/modules/org-netbeans-modules-j2ee-persistence.jar",
	        "java/modules/org-netbeans-modules-j2ee-persistenceapi.jar",
	        "ide/modules/org-netbeans-modules-web-common.jar"};

and your module identity name:

	private static final String YOUR_MODULE_NAME = "com.your-module-identify-name.here"

Module Friendlizer will add YOUR_MODULE_NAME to each module META-INF/Manifest in the modules list.

* Build it: Module Friendlizer is a typical tiny maven project:
mvn clean install assembly:single

* Running it: Module Friendlizer was first intended to embed on other project (installer), but latter It had a GUI (from Java Swing Tutorial) for user to chosing NetBeans folder.

* "License": Basically I copied its pices all over the public Internet website, and It only plays a supporting role. So feel free to use it your way.
